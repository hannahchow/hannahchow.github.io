					<div class="summary-subtitle"> — Mobile Application Interface Design</div>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-description">Fall 2018 | UI/UX</div>
			</div>
			<div class="summary-body">
				This project was a design challenge with the prompt to design a user interface and experience for users to plan a trip to a zoo before they visit. This project involves a vast iterative design and analytical process, including user personas and scenarios, competitor analysis and research, feature design, lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping, and emphasis on design decisions with justification. Additionally, I learned to tweak my own approach to product and UI/UX design under the pressure of a 48-hour deadline as well as my ability to write technically about my workflow.
			</div>
		</div>
	<div class="section-wrapper">
		<div class="section-header">Introduction</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				I was prompted to create an app that allows someone to plan their zoo visit ahead of time, and provide minimum deliverables including hi-fidelity prototypes and a minimum of three different screens. Some considerations I was asked to consider were features including the ability to choose exhibits before the visit, search functionality, saving or favoriting exhibits, and sharing a trip.

			</div>
		<div class="section-header">Analysis & Users</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				With the design and prototyping of any application or interface comes the necessity of considering the people who will actually engage with it: the users. I will consider different types of target users, including frequent visitors of the zoo, first time visitors, families, children, school or club trips, etc., and take their goals, attitudes, and behaviors into account while designing the interface for this mobile application.
				<br><br><br>
				<div class="section-subheader">Personas</div>

				<b>Cammy</b> (21) and <b>Mark</b> (20) are two university students from Singapore visiting the United States during their school holidays. Cammy is a graphic design major, and Mark is studying Computer Science, and both went to an International School when they were younger. Neither of them have been to the United States before, and Mark’s first language is not English (rather, it is Mandarin). Both love traveling to new places and going to tourist attractions. Overall, Cammy and Mark want to visit the zoo to try something new and sightsee, explore what it has to offer, and to immerse themselves in a different culture.
				<br><br>	
				<b>Bennett</b> (12) lives around five minutes away (driving) from the zoo, and has two siblings. On the weekends, his mom often drops him and his siblings off at the zoo for a few hours while she runs errands. Bennett is a huge animal lover, and mainly likes to see reptiles and amphibians, whereas his siblings like other exhibits, so oftentimes they split up. Bennett is very independent and mature for his age and is comfortable navigating the zoo by himself, but does not know exactly where the information booth his. However, if he ever gets lost, he waits by a meeting point that he and his siblings discuss beforehand. Overall, Bennett wants to visit the zoo to visit his favorite animals in an easy and safe manner, and to spend time with his siblings and family members. 
				<br><br>
				<b>Elena</b> (37) is a software engineer and a mother to two children, one of whom is in elementary school, and the other in junior high. She and her children have been going on biweekly zoo trips for a long time, on Fridays after Elena gets out of work. Her entire family is very organized, like planning out visits beforehand, and especially like including special events like feedings, shows, and lectures. Overall, Elena wants to be able to spend time with her children and relax after a long week of work while doing something both fun and educational, and to take advantage of all of the special events that her local zoo hosts.
				<br><br>
				<b>Beth</b> (45) is a teacher and lives in the same city as the zoo. She an elementary school teacher and every year takes the 25 children in her class to the zoo as part of the animal kingdom unit she teachers. She also has date nights with her husband, and they have gone to the zoo a few times to have a picnic and spontaneously visit a few exhibits. Overall, Beth wants to visit the zoo to teacher her students about the animal kingdom and biology, and to visit exhibits and relax with her husband.

				<br><br><br>
				<div class="section-subheader">User Goals & Use Cases</div>

					<ul>
						<li>Create a plan for a zoo trip that can be referenced quickly and easily.</li>
						<li>Easily change a plan or alter a plan in terms of timing and / or order.</li>
						<li>Browse exhibits and add exhibits to their plan.</li>
						<li>Search for exhibits and be able to filter by location, time, favorites, etc.</li>
						<li>Gain relevant information about exhibits (location, type of animal, special features, etc.)</li>
						<li>Save or favorite animals and exhibits.</li>
						<li>Share trip or send trip to family members.</li>
					</ul>

				<br><br>
				<div class="section-subheader">User Scenarios</div>

				I used two of my personas to create specific scenarios which entail using the app for some purpose in order to help me better understand what features are necessary, and how user flow will occur. <br><br>

				<div class="question">SCENARIO 1</div>
				<b>Cammy</b> and <b>Mark</b> have made a schedule for their zoo visit during the afternoon before their night flight back. While at the zoo, they get a notification that their flight has been delayed for a few more hours, and decide to extend their zoo trip. Mark opens the app and searches for some of the exhibits that he and Cammy have not seen yet. He selects the Lion exhibit, sees that its location is in between the Hippos and the Giraffes, and adds it to the plan. Then, he moves the Lion slot up in the plan to be between the Hippos and Giraffes.<br><br>

				<div class="question">SCENARIO 2</div>
				The day before <b>Beth’s</b> annual class trip to the zoo, she asks her class to vote on the animals they want to visit the most. The students vote on the flamingos, the pandas, and the chimpanzees, and Beth opens the app to favorite these exhibits so she will remember them. Later that night, she opens the app, navigates to her favorite exhibits, and adds the exhibits suggested by her students to the plan. Instead of the normal 20-minute slot she will use for the rest of the exhibits on the trip, she enters 30 minutes as the desired time for these exhibits, so as to allow students to spend more time at their favorite exhibits. While in the app, she opens the map and adds the restroom filter, because she knows her students will need a bathroom break at some point. She taps to add certain rest stops to the trip. Once she finalizes the plan, she shares it to the other teachers helping to coordinate the trip by entering in their phone numbers.

		<div class="section-header">Research</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				First we need to analyze why this application is being made. What are the goals of the business that this app can help with, and how can it do this better than any app on the market right now? What similar applications exist, and what are they doing well? What works, and what doesn’t? And most importantly, what can we do better? 
				<br><br><br>
				<div class="section-subheader">Business Goals</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Attract more visitors to the zoo in an engaging, informative, and convenient manner.</li>
					<li>Streamline visitors’ trips and cut down on walking / bottlenecking traffic.</li>
					<li>Advertise certain special events and animal exhibits, as well as daily tours and talks</li>
					<li>Target customers of all different ages and visit frequencies</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="section-text">
				<div class="section-subheader">Overall Shortcomings of Competitors</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Inability to keep track of exhibits / solidly create a visitor plan without the use of a third party app.</li>
					<li>Oftentimes confusing navigation or user flow.</li>
					<li>Overload of information (especially regarding the maps marked with exhibits or other locations).</li>
				</ul>

			</div>
		<div class="section-header">Features & Flow</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				After careful consideration from business goals, competitor research, and user analysis, I came up with a list of features that I wanted to have in this app.

				<br><br>
				<ul>
					<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">A splash screen with a logo.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The option to log in and view plans and/or select a zoo.</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">A bottom action center menu with sections including exhibits, a map, and plans, which will toggle between different screens of the app.</li>

					<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">A page with a minimalistic rendering of a map of the zoo.
						<ul>
							<li>Placed on the map will be pins with icons representing the exhibits.</li>
							<li>The map will also have filtering with different types of locations at the zoo, including shops, food, bathrooms, and help stations.</li> <li>When a user selects these icons, the map will populate with the locations that correspond to the selected type (in addition to the icons already on the map).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">When a pin is clicked, a bigger pin with the name underneath will expand. 
						<ul>
							<li>When this larger pin is tapped again / held, a pop up opens with the exhibit icon, name, section of where the exhibit is located, and hours an exhibit is open. </li>
							<li>Below this information will be two buttons: an info button that, when tapped, will open a page with more info about the exhibit, and a button to add the exhibit to a current plan.</li>
						</ul> 
					</li>

					<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">A page with a list view of different exhibits in alphabetical order with an alphabetical scroll on the side, as well as a search bar. These exhibits will be able to be sorted and filtered alphabetically, by favorited exhibits, and by time of day (some exhibits are scheduled). 
					</li>

					<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Each list item will contain an icon, the name of the exhibit, and the section where the exhibit is located. 
						<ul>
							<li>A button is on the right side, and when clicked, pop outs into an action menu that includes four buttons: a toggle button to favorite the exhibit, an info button that, when tapped, will open a page with more info about the exhibit, and a button to add the exhibit to a current plan, and a map pin button that allows the user to find where this exhibit is on the map page.</li>
						</ul> 
					</li>

					<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">A page with a list of all created plans. Each plan has a title, date, time, and location button, with the ability to open the plan and view / edit it. </li>

					<li>Pages for each plan. This includes a list of ordered exhibits with time slots and section locations that can be dragged around to be reordered.
						<ul>
							<li>Upon reordering, the time slots will automatically adjust. </li>
							<li>Also in the schedule are events such as lunch or bathroom breaks that the user adds. </li> 
							<li>At the top of each plan page is a button to share the plan with others (through inputting a phone number).</li>
						</ul> 
					</li>
				</ul>

		<div class="section-header">Design Decisions</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<div class="section-subheader">Prioritizing Information / Hierarchy of Information</div>
				The use cases of this app will depend on both the user and situation. Some users are interested in the background information of the animals and creating detailed plans. In other words, they want depth of information. Other users want as much efficiency as possible, and may not have a huge amount of time to navigate the app and make decisions. These users want shallower breadth of information. I solved this problem by making layers of information: information or actions that are not as important are hidden behind buttons, popouts, etc.
				<br><br><br>
				<div class="section-subheader">Focus on Iconography and Visual Representation</div>
				Zoos attract a variety of visitors, especially children (who may be at different reading levels) and tourists (who may or may not be familiar with English). Additionally, images / universal icons take up much less screen space than actual words, and thus make more sense to have in addition to or instead of words in places like action centers and maps.
				<br><br><br>
				<div class="section-subheader">Similar UI for Similar Functions</div>
				Throughout this app, there are a few buttons that appear in more than one place: the add button, the favorite button, the find-on-map button, etc. Instead of trying to differentiate these buttons for each place they are found, I unified them in the same style so as to indicate to the user a sense of familiarity. This consistent design and interaction also helps bridge the gap between the main three functions: exhibits, mapping, and planning.
				<br><br><br>
				<div class="section-subheader">Color Scheme</div>
				First and foremost, I wanted this app to be readable, which is why the vast majority of it is grayscale and neutrals. However, this is an app revolving around zoos which are often bright and playful, so I attempted to reflect this in the shades of greens I used as accent colors. Additionally, on the map (which is mostly shades of green already), I tried to differentiate some of the pit stops (bathrooms, food, info, etc.) from the map pin locations and the background with pops of color.
				<br><br><br>
				<div class="section-subheader">Bottom Navigation Bar</div>
				One of the biggest issues I noted in many competitor’s apps were that they had serious navigational flow, and it was hard to jump around the app easily. I did not want my app to have these same issues, because planning a trip requires lots of details, information, and events pulled from all over the app. My solution was to create a “home base” or central bottom navigation bar that stays consistent on every page, so that a user will be able to cycle through different parts of the app in a quick and efficient manner.
				<br><br><br>
				<div class="section-subheader">Maps vs. List Items</div>
				While doing research for this app, I came across a lot of debate between whether zoo exhibits make more sense to be represented in a list form or in a map form. There is no clear answer, and instead there are benefits to both: lists are easier to understand, sort, and filter, whereas maps help the user understand the physical and spatial aspects of the exhibits. I decided to keep both kinds of views but integrate them more thoroughly with each other than other, similar types of these apps (ex: the map button in the action popout of the exhibit list will redirect to the map pin locations, and opening a pin on the map page will display the same popups that the info and add buttons in the exhibit list do).
			</div>
		<div class="section-header">Conclusion</div>
			<div class="section-text">

				If I were to progress with this project, I would be sure to conduct user testing and A/B testing to determine pain points and bright spots of my current prototype, as well as to come up with ideas for further iteration.
				<br><br>
				I would also consider adding features that would fulfill the other major functionality requested, which is to allow users to catalogue their experience while at the zoo (some possibilities include jotting down thoughts in a trip journal, uploading and tagging photos, leaving reviews for exhibits, etc.)
				<br><br>
				Next, I would also keep in mind accessibility acommodations: Could a feature be added to determine where wheelchair accessible paths are? What about a screen reader or voice-to-text for users who are impaired?
				<br><br>
				If I wanted to start development on this application, I would consider implementing a feature and user flow in which a user's list of exhibits and generates the shortest / most convenient path for them. Visitors could have this feature automatically the most optimal route for their visit, then edit it as they see fit.
				<br><br>
				Other fun or interesting features I thought of include generating plan-specific QR codes so other visitors can instantly download plans on-the-go, the ability to pick predetermined routes that the zoo (or other visitors) create, and the option for planners to create several different options for visits and allowing others to vote on which one they want.
